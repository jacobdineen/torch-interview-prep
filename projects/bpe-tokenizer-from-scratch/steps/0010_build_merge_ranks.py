Step 0010: build_merge_ranks

Part 3 — Training the Merges
Map each merge pair to its position (rank) in the learned merge list.

Convention used throughout this tokenizer:

  The end-of-word marker is the literal string "</w>". Append it as the FINAL symbol of
  every word (so a word-final piece is distinguishable from a word-internal one), and strip
  it again when decoding back to text. Symbol sequences are tuples of strings, e.g.
  ("l", "o", "w", "</w>").
Every other function in this project is also available in your namespace at grade
time — call earlier steps by name; you do not import them. Run
`uv run python projects.py bpe-tokenizer-from-scratch` (or the outline drawer) to see all signatures."""
