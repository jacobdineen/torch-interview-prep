Step 0014: causal_block_mask

Part 4 — Causal Flash Attention
Return a copy of S_block with entries whose absolute key index exceeds the absolute query index set to -inf.

Conventions: single-head, no batch. Q (N,d), K (M,d), V (M,d), output O (N,d); scores S (N,M);
per-row stats m, l, L, D are shape (N,). `scale` is the scalar the caller passes (1/sqrt(d)).
The flash forward tiles over key/value blocks and keeps an UNNORMALIZED running output that is
divided by the running denominator l only at the end.
Every other function in this project is also available in your namespace at grade
time — call earlier steps by name; you do not import them. Run
`uv run python projects.py flash-attention-from-scratch` (or the outline drawer) to see all signatures."""
